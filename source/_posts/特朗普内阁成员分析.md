## 成员分析
1. 连同总统在内一共是24人，包括16名内阁成员和8名内阁级别官员。
2. 共有8名女性，占比33.3%。女性比例在内阁成员中这个不算低了。
3. 当然种族上是有很明显的白人为主的特征。24个内阁成员，一共三个非白种人。一个亚裔加巴德当国家情报总监，加巴德拥有萨摩亚血统，曾经是民主党全国委员会副主席；一个黑人，斯科特·特纳，担任住房与城市发展部长，他曾经是橄榄球运动员；一个拉丁裔，国务卿鲁比奥，他是古巴移民，在中国的制裁名单上。
4. 学术背景很强。宾大、哥伦比亚大学、耶鲁，哈佛，普林斯顿、斯坦福、德州大学奥斯汀分校，这些都属于美国的名校。
5. 最年轻的是副总统JD Vance，生于1984年8月2日。
6. 国防部长Pete Hegseth差一点没通过参议院的任命。当时他的票数是50对50，靠了Vance的一票才最终通过司法部长的任命。
